## background

from [klakie v0](https://github.com/ronnaf/klakie):

> it's annoying to copy time entries from clockify because the timer starts when you hit ctrl+c so i decided to just make a webapp that pulls my data from clockify and just display the time entries in decimal format that i can easily copy.
